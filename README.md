# deep learning lectures

Google Colab notebooks and sample datasets for the intensive *Crash Course in Deep Learning*, at Kaunas University of Applied Sciences, Lithuania

## 1. Python tutorials

This section offers 3 tutorials to familiarize with some basic libraries in Python:
- [tutorial_1_numpy.ipynb](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/georgiosouzounis/deep-learning-lectures/main/tutorial_1_numpy.ipynb)
- [tutorial_1_pandas.ipynb](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/georgiosouzounis/deep-learning-lectures/main/tutorial_2_pandas.ipynb)
- [tutorial_1_matplotlib.ipynb](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/georgiosouzounis/deep-learning-lectures/main/tutorial_3_matplotlib.ipynb)



## 2. Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)

<br/>

In this notebook you will be tasked to solve a churn prediction problem using an artificial neural network classifier. The purpose of this study is to showcase how to:
- interrogate your data and apply basic data preprocessing methods for optimizing your tables;
- create a custom neural network classifier using Keras;
- train and deploy the ANN
- evaluate the model performance
- optimize/fine-tune the model

The code is available in [artificial_neural_networks.ipynb](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/georgiosouzounis/deep-learning-lectures/main/artificial_neural_networks.ipynb).


## 3. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

<br/>

In this notebook you will be tasked to solve a stock price prediction problem using recurrent neural networks. The purpose of this study is to showcase how to:
- obtain finacial data (stock prices),
- import it into dataframes and organize the later by filtering our redundant columns,
- transform the input data into meaningful feature vectors,
- create a custom reccurent neural network regressor using Keras,
- train and deploy the RNN,
- evaluate the model performance,
- optimize/fine-tune the model.

Enjoy
