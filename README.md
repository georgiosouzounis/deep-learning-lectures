Google Colab notebooks and sample datasets for the intensive *Crash Course in Deep Learning*, at Kaunas University of Applied Sciences, Lithuania

## 1. Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)

In this notebook the student will be tasked to solve a churn prediction problem using an artificial neural network classifier. The purpose of this study is to showcase how to:
- interogate your data and apply basic data preprocessing methods for optimizing your tables;
- create a custom neural network classifier using Keras;
- train and deploy the ANN
- evaluate the model performance
- optimize/fine tune the model

## 2. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

shortly

## 3. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)

shortly
