# deep-learning-lectures

Google Colab notebooks and sample datasets for the intensive *Crash Course in Deep Learning*, at Kaunas University of Applied Sciences, Lithuania

## 1. Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)

In this notebook the student will be tasked to solve a churn prediction problem using an artificial neural network classifier. The purpose of this study is to showcase how to:
- interogate your data and apply basic data preprocessing methods for optimizing your tables;
- create a custom neural network classifier using Keras;
- train and deploy the ANN
- evaluate the model performance
- optimize/fine-tune the model

The code is available in [artificial_neural_networks.ipynb](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/georgiosouzounis/deep-learning-lectures/main/artificial_neural_networks.ipynb).


## 2. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
